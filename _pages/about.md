My name is Huixin Zhan. I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science, Texas Tech University](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/), where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Victor Sheng](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/victor_sheng/index.php). Previously, I did my undergraduate study at Nanjing University of Science and Technology. 

I am interested in machine learning, knowledge graph and crowdsourcing security & privacy.
