My name is Huixin Zhan. I am currently a Postdoctoral Scientist in the Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine at [Cedars-Sinai Medical Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.org). Previous, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/) at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/), where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Victor Sheng](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/victor_sheng/index.php). Previously, I earned my MS from the University of Texas at San Antonio, and I did my undergraduate study at Nanjing University of Science and Technology. 

In general, I am interested in machine learning, knowledge graph, graph neural networks, text summarization, and security & privacy in text mining.
